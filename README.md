# SecureFreel
The vision of SecureFreel is to revolutionize freelance work by providing a secure, anonymous platform for clients and freelancers. Through Privado ID and M-Pesa integration, the platform ensures confidentiality, privacy, and seamless transactions, empowering both parties to collaborate efficiently without compromising on security or convenience.

Recent development is to migrate the project to Base and Stylus Arbitrum Chains.
